	  WireGuard is a secure, fast, and easy to use replacement for IPSec
	  that uses modern cryptography and clever networking tricks. It's
	  designed to be fairly general purpose and abstract enough to fit most
	  use cases, while at the same time remaining extremely simple to
	  configure. See www.wireguard.com for more info.

	  It's safe to say Y or M here, as the driver is very lightweight and
	  is only in use when an administrator chooses to add an interface.

	  This will write log messages for handshake and other events
	  that occur for a WireGuard interface. It will also perform some
	  extra validation checks and unit tests at various points. This is
	  only useful for debugging.

	  Say N here unless you know what you're doing.

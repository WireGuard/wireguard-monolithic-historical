wg - set and retrieve configuration of WireGuard interfaces

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B wg 
is the configuration utility for getting and setting the configuration of
WireGuard tunnel interfaces. The interfaces themselves can be added and removed
using
.BR ip-link (8)
and their IP addresses and routing tables can be set using
.BR ip-address (8)
and
.BR ip-route (8).
The
.B wg
utility provides a series of sub-commands for changing WireGuard-specific
aspects of WireGuard interfaces.

If no COMMAND is specified, COMMAND defaults to
.BR show .
Sub-commands that take an INTERFACE must be passed a WireGuard interface.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
\fBshow\fP { \fI<interface>\fP | \fIall\fP | \fIinterfaces\fP } [\fIpublic-key\fP | \fIprivate-key\fP | \fIpreshared-key\fP | \fIlisten-port\fP | \fIpeers\fP | \fIendpoints\fP | \fIallowed-ips\fP | \fIlatest-handshake\fP | \fIbandwidth\fP]
Shows current WireGuard configuration of specified \fI<interface>\fP.
If no \fI<interface>\fP is specified, \fI<interface>\fP defaults to \fIall\fP.
If \fIinterfaces\fP is specified, prints a list of all WireGuard interfaces,
one per line, and quit. If no options are given after the interface
specification, then prints a list of all attributes in a visually pleasing way
meant for the terminal. Otherwise, prints specified information grouped by
newlines and tabs, meant to be used in scripts.
.TP
\fBshowconf\fP \fI<interface>\fP
Shows the current configuration of \fI<interface>\fP in the format described
by \fICONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT\fP below.
.TP
\fBset\fP \fI<interface>\fP [\fIlisten-port\fP \fI<port>\fP] [\fIprivate-key\fP \fI<file-path>\fP] [\fIpreshared-key\fP \fI<file-path>\fP] [\fIpeer\fP \fI<base64-public-key>\fP [\fIremove\fP] [\fIendpoint\fP \fI<ip>:<port>\fP] [\fIallowed-ips\fP \fI<ip1>/<cidr1>\fP[,\fI<ip2>/<cidr2>\fP]...] ]...
Sets configuration values for the specified \fI<interface>\fP. Multiple
\fIpeer\fPs may be specified, and if the \fIremove\fP argument is given
for a peer, that peer is removed, not configured. If \fIlisten-port\fP
is not specified, the port will be automatically generated when the
interface comes up. Both \fIprivate-key\fP and \fIpreshared-key\fP must
be a files, because command line arguments are not considered private on
most systems but if you are using
.BR bash (1),
you may safely pass in a string by specifying as \fIprivate-key\fP or
\fIpreshared-key\fP the expression: <(echo PRIVATEKEYSTRING). If
\fI/dev/null\fP is specified as the filename for either \fIprivate-key\fP or
\fIpreshared-key\fP, the key is removed from the device. The use of
\fIpreshared-key\fP is optional, and may be omitted; it adds an additional
layer of symmetric-key cryptography to be mixed into the already existing
public-key cryptography, for post-quantum resistance. If \fIallowed-ips\fP
is specified, but the value is the empty string, all allowed ips are removed
from the peer.
.TP
\fBsetconf\fP \fI<interface>\fP \fI<configuration-filename>\fP
Sets the current configuration of \fI<interface>\fP to the contents of
\fI<configuration-filename>\fP, which must be in the format described
by \fICONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT\fP below.
.TP
\fBaddconf\fP \fI<interface>\fP \fI<configuration-filename>\fP
Appends the contents of \fI<configuration-filename>\fP, which must
be in the format described by \fICONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT\fP below,
to the current configuration of \fI<interface>\fP.
.TP
\fBgenkey\fP
Generates a random \fIprivate\fP key in base64 and prints it to
standard output.
.TP
\fBgenpsk\fP
Generates a random \fIpreshared\fP key in base64 and prints it to
standard output.
.TP
\fBpubkey\fP
Calculates a \fIpublic\fP key and prints it in base64 to standard
output from a corresponding \fIprivate\fP key (generated with
\fIgenkey\fP) given in base64 on standard input.

A private key and a corresponding public key may be generated at once by calling:
.br
    $ umask 077
.br
    $ wg genkey | tee private.key | wg pubkey > public.key
.TP
\fBhelp\fP
Show usage message.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
The configuration file format is based on \fIINI\fP. There are two top level sections
-- \fIInterface\fP and \fIPeer\fP. Multiple \fIPeer\fP sections may be specified, but
only one \fIInterface\fP section may be specified.

.P
The \fIInterface\fP section contains two fields:
.IP \(bu
PrivateKey \(em a base64 private key generated by \fIwg genkey\fP. Required.
.IP \(bu
PresharedKey \(em a base64 preshared key generated by \fIwg genpsk\fP. Optional,
and may be omitted. This option adds an additional layer of symmetric-key
cryptography to be mixed into the already existing public-key cryptography,
for post-quantum resistance.
.IP \(bu
ListenPort \(em a 16-bit port for listening. Optional; if not specified,
automatically generated based on interface name.
.P
The \fIPeer\fP sections contain three fields each:
.IP \(bu
PublicKey \(em a base64 public key calculated by \fIwg pubkey\fP from a
private key, and usually transmitted out of band to the author of the
configuration file. Required.
.IP \(bu
AllowedIPs \(em a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses with
CIDR masks from which this peer is allowed to send incoming traffic and
to which outgoing traffic for this peer is directed. The catch-all
\fI0.0.0.0/0\fP may be specified for matching all IPv4 addresses, and
\fI::/0\fP may be specified for matching all IPv6 addresses. Required.
.IP \(bu
Endpoint \(em an endpoint IP or hostname, followed by a colon, and then a
port number. Optional.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT EXAMPLE
This example may be used as a model for writing configuration files.
Note that not all keys are required.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.I WG_COLOR_MODE
If set to \fIalways\fP, always print ANSI colorized output. If set to \fInever\fP, never print ANSI colorized output. If set to \fIauto\fP, something invalid, or unset, then print ANSI colorized output only when writing to a TTY.
